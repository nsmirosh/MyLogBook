General comments:
- make sure you have Clean Architecture, dependency rule is really really important.
- Consistency, it give a better impression if you chose one solution for one type of problem e.g. 
  sometimes you have a toSomething function in a class sometimes you have an extension function.
- I would add modules, to show off, app, presentation, domain, data to show that's something I know.


I would also write in the readme file about decisions I made, e.g if you add modules I would write 
something about it being over kill for small projects like this but that you usually do this in bigger 
projects. 

I would add some comments about what I would do going forward with the project, e.g. structure changes, 
design patterns etc.
